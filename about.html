            <h2>Eggdog is a fictional character created by Rapid Liquid and zamsire. He appears in a Rapid Liquid video titled 'eggdog' that shows a video of a white dog in the shape of an egg being trimmed. Zamsire's eggdog videos show Eggdog in various locations, occasionally with strawberries, yet always turning their heads and some of them streching their necks very high.</h2>

            <h2>This is Eggcat, a strange looking cat that is found on the internet. They could be watching you right now, watching you read a paragraph about them. They could be nearby, just beside you, looking at you directly. They could be anywhere where you are, they could be stalking you, waiting for the right moment to strike. They could kill you in a second and hide your body in an isolated place and no one would find your body, they could make everyone forget you existed. But they don't. Because they are Eggcat. They are an egg but a cat. people's eggcat. Is the controlator of the simulation where eggdogs live. The eggcat is cute, but it behaves very badly with the eggdogs.</h2>
